MyToken Contract

This Solidity contract represents a basic token called "RALPH" with the symbol "RAL". The contract allows the creation and destruction of tokens for specific addresses. Let's explore the contract's functionalities and variables.

Public Variables

- tokenName: A string variable representing the name of the token. In this case, it is set to "RALPH".
- tokenAbbrv: A string variable representing the abbreviation or symbol of the token. Here, it is set to "RAL".
- totalSupply: An unsigned integer variable holding the total supply of tokens. Initially, it is set to 0.

Mapping

- balances: A mapping that associates addresses with their respective token balances. Each address is mapped to an unsigned integer representing the balance of tokens held by that address.

Mint Function

The mint function is used to create new tokens and assign them to a specified address. It takes two parameters:

- _address: The address to which the tokens will be assigned.
- _value: The number of tokens to be created and assigned.

The function increases the total supply by the given value and adds the same value to the balance of the specified address.

Burn Function

The burn function is used to destroy existing tokens held by a specified address. It takes two parameters:

- _address: The address from which the tokens will be burned.
- _value: The number of tokens to be burned.

The function checks if the balance of the specified address is greater than or equal to the given value. If it is, it reduces the total supply by the given value and deducts the same value from the balance of the specified address.
